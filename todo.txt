* Change vertex data
* Do 3D projection (3D model space coords -> 2d projection coords)
	* Make a cube with the vertex
	* Change the perspective
	* Make the faces of the cube have different colors
	* Move the perspective around the cube while rendering
* Load an STL to get 3D model space coords
	* Add a model class that contains coords etc.
	* Import the teapot
	* Add texture data / color
	* Read the vertex data, try to change data while rendering
* Scale the model
* Get use input to move the model about it's center
* Scale the model automatically, based on the farthest point from the center


* Final Goal: A little window that will load an STL file specified as input
	the model will be fit in the window (This will be a scale operation not done
	by a shader) the user will be able to click and drag with their mouse to move
	the model
